## üé® Style Guidelines

### Java Style Guide

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line Length**: Maximum 120 characters
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Methods/Variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Packages: `lowercase`
- **Comments**: Use Javadoc for public methods and classes
- **Imports**: Organize imports, remove unused ones

**Example**:
```java
/**
 * Service for managing expenses.
 */
@Service
public class ExpenseService {
    private static final String DEFAULT_CURRENCY = "USD";
    
    private final ExpenseRepository expenseRepository;
    
    /**
     * Creates a new expense.
     * 
     * @param expense the expense to create
     * @return the created expense
     */
    public Expense createExpense(Expense expense) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### TypeScript/React Style Guide

- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces
- **Line Length**: Maximum 100 characters
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Components: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/Variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase`
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Types**: Always use TypeScript types/interfaces
- **Imports**: Organize imports (React first, then external, then internal)

**Example**:
```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button, TextField } from '@mui/material';
import { ExpenseService } from '../services/ExpenseService';

interface ExpenseFormProps {
  onSubmit: (expense: Expense) => void;
  initialData?: Expense;
}

const ExpenseForm: React.FC<ExpenseFormProps> = ({ onSubmit, initialData }) => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<Expense>(initialData || {
    description: '',
    amount: 0,
  });

  // Component implementation
};

export default ExpenseForm;
```

### CSS/Styling Guidelines

- Use Material-UI's `sx` prop or styled components
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use theme variables for colors and spacing
- Maintain consistent spacing (use theme spacing units)

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual methods and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% coverage
- **Naming**: Use descriptive test names

**Example**:
```java
@Test
void testCreateExpense_WithValidData_ShouldReturnCreatedExpense() {
    // Given
    Expense expense = new Expense();
    expense.setDescription("Test expense");
    
    // When
    Expense created = expenseService.createExpense(expense);
    
    // Then
    assertNotNull(created);
    assertEquals("Test expense", created.getDescription());
}
```

### Frontend Testing

- **Component Tests**: Test component rendering and behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Coverage**: Aim for at least 70% coverage
- **Tools**: Use React Testing Library and Vitest

**Example**:
```typescript
describe('ExpenseForm', () => {
  it('should render form fields', () => {
    render(<ExpenseForm onSubmit={jest.fn()} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByLabelText('Description')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByLabelText('Amount')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should call onSubmit with form data', async () => {
    const handleSubmit = jest.fn();
    render(<ExpenseForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />);
    
    await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText('Description'), 'Test');
    await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText('Amount'), '100');
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }));
    
    expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      expect.objectContaining({
        description: 'Test',
        amount: 100,
      })
    );
  });
});
```

## üìù Commit Guidelines
